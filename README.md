#Postgraduate Bursary Eligibility Checker

##About
This is a small application that I developed to search a national database of postcodes, returning the POLAR 3 classification and also a country appropriate Index of Multiple Deprivation. More about the site can be found over on my [blog](http://www.alex-singleton.com/website/2015/03/26/Postgraduate-Bursary-Checker/).

This repository contains the code used to build the website; and also to process the open data required to create the database. This is also available as an SPL dump, so if you wished to replicate what I have done, it saves having to re-run all the R code.

Repository contains:

* [R Code](https://github.com/alexsingleton/PBEC/blob/master/Data_Processing.Rmd)
* [Website Code (PHP / Leaflet / MYSQL / Cartodb)](https://github.com/alexsingleton/PBEC/tree/master/website)
* [Database (zipped .SQL)](https://github.com/alexsingleton/PBEC/tree/master/database)
